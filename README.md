# BaSim (modified by 96jonesa)

Fork of Henke's Old School RuneScape Barbarian Assault simulator. At the time of forking, the simulator only supported Runners, Defenders, and Collectors.

I intend to expand the simulator to include all relevant components required to run reinforcement learning on it for the purpose of solving for best strategies.

I originally rewrote and expanded in Python, however some portions ran far too slowly. So, I am using this as an excuse to learn JavaScript + Node.js and test out the reinforcement learning libraries available for JavaScript.
